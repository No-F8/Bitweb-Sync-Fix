## ðŸ“¥ Installation Instructions

1. **Close** your Bitweb Core wallet if it's running.
2. **Backup** your wallet and data folder:
   - Make a copy of your `wallets/` directory and `wallet.dat` file if you're not doing a clean install.
3. **Download** the latest `bitweb-bootstrap-20250715.zip` file from the Releases section.
4. **Extract** the contents into your Bitweb data directory:
   - Windows default:  
     `C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\Bitweb\`
   - Linux default:  
     `~/.bitweb/`
5. **Start** your Bitweb wallet â€” it will begin syncing from the current chain tip without re-downloading old blocks.

## âœ… Notes

- This is an **NitroPool official snapshot** taken from our fully synced node.
- Useful for speeding up sync time or recovering from corrupt chainstate.
- If you experience issues with the bootstrap, try starting Bitweb with the `-reindex` flag once.
